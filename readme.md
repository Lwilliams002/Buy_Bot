The goal of this project is to develop a solution that alerts users when UFC tickets become available for purchase. The solution will use the Ticketmaster API and the OneSignal API to accomplish this.

The Ticketmaster API will be used to retrieve information about the availability of UFC tickets. The OneSignal API will be used to send push notifications to the users when tickets become available.

The solution will be built using Python and will consist of two main components: a script to make the API requests and a script to send the push notifications. The script that makes the API requests will use the Ticketmaster API to retrieve information about the availability of UFC tickets. If the information indicates that tickets are available for a specific event, such as UFC 287, the script will trigger the second script to send the push notification to the users.

The push notification will contain information about the availability of the tickets, including the event name and the ticket status. Users will receive the push notification on their devices, providing them with a quick and convenient way to stay up-to-date on the availability of UFC tickets.

This project is ideal for sports fans who are interested in purchasing UFC tickets and want to be informed as soon as tickets become available. It provides a simple and efficient way for users to stay informed about the availability of tickets without having to constantly check the website for updates.
