Introduction
This project aims to create a bot to purchase a product on a website. The bot automates the process of visiting the
website, selecting the desired product, and entering payment information. This is done using a combination of web
scraping and automated form submissions.

Next Steps

Access the website: use a tool such as the requests library in Python to access the website programmatically.

Locate the desired product: The bot extracts the information about the product to be purchased, such as its URL, price,
and availability, using web scraping techniques.

Enter payment information: The bot automates the process of entering payment information, such as the credit card
details and billing address, by submitting a form programmatically using the requests library or another tool.

Submit the order: The bot submits the order and makes the purchase, handling any error messages or confirmations
returned by the website to ensure that the purchase was successful.

Considerations
It's important to note that while this approach can be effective, it may also be against the terms of service of some
websites and may result in the bot's account being banned. Additionally, there may be security risks associated with
storing sensitive information, such as credit card details, in the bot's script.

Given these considerations, I have to thoroughly research the legal and ethical implications of automating
purchases before proceeding with this project.
